  CALCULATION VERIFICATION - SAMPLE
================================================================================

Apple SELL Calculation:
  Full position: $15,000 (current), $10,000 (cost basis)
  Selling: $5,000 (1/3 of position)

  Step 1: Proportional Cost Basis
    ($5,000 / $15,000) × $10,000 = $3,333.33 ✓

  Step 2: Capital Gains
    $5,000 - $3,333.33 = $1,666.67 ✓

  Step 3: Tax at 22%
    $1,666.67 × 0.22 = $366.67 ✓

  Step 4: Trade Fee
    $5,000 × 0.001 = $5.00 ✓

  Step 5: Net Proceeds
    $5,000 - $366.67 - $5.00 = $4,628.33 ✓
